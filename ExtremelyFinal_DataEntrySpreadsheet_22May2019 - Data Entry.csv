The ""extreme"" event occurred in 2010, and the biol. data (on Snook distributions) were from 2012-24. Further, the biological data taken were not a response to cold events. Instead, they asked where in the estuary snook are when cold events occur across years, and then talk about how that spatial distribution might that influence their vulnerability. So, its not really a response in the sense we are looking for. ",I agree that this is not technically measuring a biological response to an extreme event and should be excluded.

It shows that spatial factors, rather than environmental processes, are more important to the structure of macrobenthic assemblages. All the results are based on which variables explain a higher proportion of the variance. While there were two 'storm' events in the study, no direct connection or statistical analysis is made to either event.","authors say that region is subject to frontal systems that increase current speed by 8 fold and produce storm waves with heights up to 6.4 m. Samples were collected four times throughout the year (3 month intervals) and 2 sampling times were following storms, but the storms do not seem to be anomolous to regular weather in the region. They interpret environmental parameters in terms of storms, fine sediment increased from Spetember (after storms), salinity was lower during storm season. I guess only thing I might add to the spreadsheet is the environmental variable measured (if we keep this study in the meta-analysis) - Physical responses include: Temperature - multidirectional (seasonal variation stronger than storm effect), Salinity - decreases, Mean grain size - no change, silt and clay (%) - increases, Fine sand (%) - increases, Coarse sand (%) - decreases, pebbles (%) - decreases, organic matter (%) - increases, CaCO3 (%) - decreases, Wave height (m) - increases, Wave Power (W/s) - increases. It seems like only wave height and wave power are publicly available raw data (from NOAA). The mean and se are available for every variable at each sampling time as an appendix table (pdf, not spreadsheet). Whether we include this I guess depends on how we define extreme event ... 21 ft waves aree kind of extreme, but if they are normal for the region then *technically* not extreme. "

I may not be adept at interpreting models like this, but since there were no p-values or hypothesis-testing reported, I wouldn't classify the results as “significant” - I might also suggest downgrading from “extreme” to large because of the multi directionality of the results (some species were not affected by the flooding).
I added physical variables measured in the study- although they were used more as covariates than responses. Slope was the most important physical parameter - I used channel form to indicate this, but there could be a more specififc descriptor."

This paper documents breeding ecology of sea birds at two nesting sites in the Canadian high arctic. They find that the nesting site at the higher latitude experiences more failed nests and that nests are often abandoned during storms (same pattern but less often at lower latiitude), but there are not any weather events that are out of the ordinary for the region.
