only instered years, but could be changed to 01YYYY if easier for analysis.","This study was somewhat confusing, as they measured many responses and wrote many descriptions but did not indicate statistical increase/decreases. I may have missed some responses, as they were not often well-described in the methods. I also said there was a decrease in CO2 flux because it went from an influx (i.e, C sink) to efflux (i.e., C source)","interesting study looking at ecosystem recovery/resiliency 3 years after an extreme drought; the typical response of increase/decrease don't really fit this study; the main result showed a recovery of food web structure post drought and that food webs were homogenous throughout the estuary, as compared to disparate during the drought; chemical responses are reported as a general statement about the current status 3 years post drought but give no indication to how they compare to values during drought","This one is weird, in that there isn't a particular extreme event - just precip and temperature extremes over the climate record.","NaN","NaN","Month not indicated for several of the parameters - only instered years, but could be changed to 01YYYY if easier for analysis.","This study measured both mechanical and chemical sediment transport in relation to low/high rainfall years, so it is listed as both a physical and chemical response. They define the one monsoon year as a one in a century event. ","NaN","NaN","NaN","No statistical testing ... ?","NaN","This paper captures 3 extreme (&gt;99th percentile) heatwave type events on Lake Geneva over a 4 year period. Their primary response variable is proportion cyanobacteria. They measured other physical and chemical parameters, but these were used to build a MARS model for the entire 8 year dataset to predict cynao biomass. They show that water temp was corelated with numerous physical and chemical parameters, but I did not include them here, as those correlations seem to be derived from the global dataset model, rather than an explicit response to the 3 extreme events this study captured.   ","Some fish increased abundance; some fish decreased abundance, hence, multidirectional response","This study assessed mesoplankton abundance/density in a PCA, hence the multidirectional and small-sig distinctions","three of the frog species were resilient to the flood (occupied 60% of sites post flood), three species were not resilient (occupied 20% of sites or less post flood) - hence multi-directional","The responses were interpreted from a recovery time series after a major drought (the first measurement was during the drought and the subsequent ones were after); not sure this interpretation is appropriate","Temperature data were used from http://boon.ucdavis.edu/, and the authors used these data combined with ealier data from their sites to predict what the temperature was like at their specific sites during their sampling period","The authors presented discharge data, which peaked in the El Nino year (1982-83) but they did not analyze or use discharge as a response variable, so I didn't include it. ","This study investigated the effect of flooding and floodplain connectivity on the diet of flathead catfish. In the flood year, they had less catches (hypothesized that fish were more spread out) but average catch size was larger and a larger proportion of catches had full stomachs. Additionally, the size at which fish switched from a invertebrate diet to a vertebrate diet was smaller during the flood year. The flood was described as \"record flooding\" and \"unprecedented precipitation\" but was not directly referred to as an extreme event. ","Didn't measure responses before and after event because they were measuring fish abundance in floodplain environments; not sure if we can count the presence ot fish in areas where they weren't before as an increase in abundance? They don't show this change explicitly, but it is inferred","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","They sampled around 3 different droughts (1989-1990, 2001-2002, 2011-2013). field measures of popns were from different times since droughts, but not chronological- they pieced together the times from samples post-different droughts.","Note the authors were comparing responses of urbanized and non-urbanized beaches; they found significant increases in the biological response variables at the non-urbanized beaches but no response at the urbanized beaches. They also measured responses after 2 separate extreme events (storms). After the second event, all responses were non-significnat. My interpretation is therefore that the biological responses were \"multi-directional\" and \"large-sig\" since some significant responses were measured. ","\"Water quality\" response included secchi depth, salinity, and total nitrogen in a combined response variable developed from a principle components analysis; water quality responses had pre-storm sampling data; biological responses did not","This is a weird one - didn't actually measure anything except Microcystis abundance, but used a SWAT model to (somehow) link increased SRP loading due to one extreme precipitation event to a massive cyano bloom the following summer.","Using overall response along entire river reach; both vegetation and sediment erosion/deposition were multi-directional at individual river reaches but overall were multidirectional (vegetation) or erosional (sediment)","NaN","The authors studied separate fish populations in three different systems: lagoons, freshwater swamps, and a freshwater stream; I include separate lines for these different systems","NaN","they saw a decrease in the most common seagrass before the extreme event (Amphibolis antarctica) and an increase in early successional tropical segrasses (Halodule uninervis). ","In this study, the authors compared the abundance, growth, movement, and seawater readiness of salmon and steelhead trout in the same lagoon that was closed from the ocean due to extreme drought. The measurements were only made during the time when the lagoon was closed, i.e. during the extreme event, so there were no significance tests of the effects of the event ","NaN","NaN","NaN","Study did not explicitly state an extreme event occured, but rather several storm events. I have included results from the 'most severe' storm event here.","NaN","The authors mainly focused on comparing urchin size, condition, and abundance between different sites, all measured in 2013, 2 years after the heatwave. However, they note that one site was more heavily impacted by the heatwave (data not shown in this paper) and that there were no differences between the impacted site and the less impacted sites 2 years later. ","Is a river basin a stream/river or a watershed/catchment? Should we consider remotely sensed EVI data as \"percent cover\"?","NaN","Just a note - this was a modelling paper, so they used spatially-extensive MODIS capture to analyze river connectivity response. They did seem to have flow data before and after the flood, but did not use it. I have put that they measured discharge as the main parameter, but the response they were interested in was river connectivity.","This study examines the stabiliyt of moss populations at two sties: 1) Vishnu Spring in Illinois (40.43332778, -90.89611111) and Thompson Creek in Virginia (38.67701667, - 77.20777778). No specific extreme event is considered, but the effect of several extreme precipitation events are considered on moss population stability. Moreover, only erosion was correlated to the occurrence of extreme precipitation; thus I only extracted data on erosion, not for moss","NaN","Month not indicated for several of the parameters - only instered years, but could be changed to 01YYYY if easier for analysis.","The extreme event is really prolongued dessication, driven by strong, dry wind and warm temperatures.

reader":["I'm pretty sure the first month of benthic data collection was April (at HKC; May at Big Sulphur Creek), so I added April. Maybe replace \"community composition\" with stability and persistance as responses (they would be multidirectional, because increase after drought in 1st order but decrease in 2-,3-order). I also didn't know what to say for the effect size, so added \"unclear\". Would probably put \"Large\" for stability and persistance, but hard to say. this was a tough one since it presents so many years of data!","This is a really confusing paper! ","NaN","NaN","This paper is interesting as it describes 2 different extreme events (a cold front and a drought) and the resulting influence on fish abundance.","I think this is the correct #9? Pretty confusing paper - talked a lot about extreme events but very little about the actual biological response to the events categorized. Just included events where they explicitly indicated what the biological response was.","I'm not convinced they really measured diversity with MCI (even though they say they did), since its an index that takes into account sensitivity not just diversity - I might directly call the response Macroinvertebrate Community Index. Month is a bit confusing - doesn't specify for physical/chemical parameters, but would be March for biological. I added March in the two lines that deal with biological samples. Suggest changing the stream flow effect size to \"large - sig not tested\" (instead of \"large -non-sig\"). I think DO should be a \"decrease\", not \"no response\" - looks like it decreased in all three subregions. Maybe change the trophic level of the bacteria to \"bacterial grazer\"? hard to find out what fecal choliform bacteria actually do, other than indicate water quality! ","I can't find a significance test of the discharge (might be a data entry error?) I would list as \"large - sig not tested\"","NaN","NaN","For Sampling_MonthYearStart I changed 012003 to 102003, because analyzed data were from autumn period (Oct - Dec)","This entry was assigned unique accession number 17 - which did not match the other #17; does this belong to #41? -BJS  ---- I think this is paper #16 - it is also in Shark Bay, but is a totally different paper - Jenna","NaN","Agree with your comment - my main take-home was the increse in biomass for the 3 extreme heat-related events!","I think the month start date would be January (sampled quarterly, &amp; they sampled the lower stretch beginning in Jan). I would agree the discharge after the droughts was lower, but not extreme for the effect size- it doesn't look like in 2007 it decreased much at all. Maybe \"large- sig not tested\"?","Everything looks good for this entry","I might suggest changing community composition to species evenness  (overall diversity did not decrease, no species went extinct, but abundance of some groups decreased). I may not be adept at interpreting models like this, but since there were no p-values or hypothesis-testing reported, I wouldn't classify the results as \u201csignificant\u201d - I might also suggest downgrading from \u201cextreme\u201d to large because of the multi directionality of the results (some species were not affected by the flooding).\nI added physical variables measured in the study- although they were used more as covariates than responses. Slope was the most important physical parameter - I used channel form to indicate this, but there could be a more specififc descriptor.","Ya, they say the drought ends in 2002 (no month stated), but their first sampling is Dec 2001 and they frame it as a post-drought analysis; they also measure water temperature, conductivity, and nutrient concentrations- do we want to include these? (Table 2); so since this a recovery thing, is that why the responses are \"decreased\" instead of \"increased\"- for example, they saw taxa richness increase after the drought, so the effect of the drought is that it decreased? Maybe we should check in with the group about this. DO NOT USE RESPONSE VARIABLES BECAUSE THESE ARE INTERPRETED AS RECOVERY IN RESPONSE TO EXTREME EVENT. DESCRIPTIVE ATTRIBUTES ARE STILL USE-ABLE.","That use of temperature data seems fine, but maybe we should have a way to identify whether these types of data were collected specifically by authors, or accessed from other sources? Not sure if it matters...","I changed the PhysicalResponseCategory to water from sediment and PhysicalResponseMeasured from turbidity to sediment transport; A point for discussion: While sediment transport/TSS decreased following the high flow periods in 1982-1983, it probably spiked during those high flows; so should the response be increase followed by decrease? The difference is in the immediate vs. longer-term effects","I agreed with the assessment of the 1st reader, though I added GPS coordinates for the study site at Schilling NE","I think we leave the as unspecified/unclear since it wasn't explicitly stated. Another possibility is to view this through the lens of how the fish community changes across different habitats in a floodplain during a flood (there is also some physical habitat data - water depth, temp., velocity - that could be extracted). But this too may be too much inference on our part...","Found an increase in bird movement following typhoon events and a decrease in invertebrate density in streams in Taiwan. Classified any type of typhoon as an 'extreme event' and compared to years w/o typhoon's as 'normal' years.","I almost wonder if \"flood\" is the right kind of event for a mud volcano - maybe a landslide would be better? The authors note that discharge was not affected by the mud, whereas in other flood papers discharge would be the major factor affected.","NaN","NaN","I would argue that they did make a climate linkage. There's a paragraph in the intro that talks about droughts and climate change. -- Agree, changed! -Jenna","I suggest changing the response for both wave height and wave period to increase and decrease, respectively (see Tables 1 &amp; 3 and first paragraph of Results for Scenarios 1 and 2). I think their p-values and Dunn test indicate differences in pre vs. during event heights and periods. Changed!","NaN","-suggest that the sampling before should be \"years\" and continuous monitoring prior should be \"y\", since in the SI info it says they sampled at biweekly interals from 2002-2011. that would be just for the microsystis abundance data, but I think that's ok. Looks like they published on these data previously (in \"A novel method for tracking western Lake Erie Microcystis blooms, 2002\u20132011\"), so they don't give the methods here, but since it's the same group and really the same study I think it should count.. does that make sense?\n- I think \"sampling duration during\" should be months, since it looks like they sampled biweekly in 2011\n-for the sampling unit spatial extent, looks like they used the same 6 sample sites as the paper \"A novel method for tracking western Lake Erie Microcystis blooms, 2002\u20132011\" (ref 1 in SI) I don't actually have access to this paper- do you? Not sure how important it is to track down. I also think this method means the \"replicate samples\" column should be Y, since they had duplicate tows from 6 sites\n- suggest changing biological response effect size to \"large - sig not tested\"  instead of no response. For the chemical response, perhaps change effect size to \"extreme - sig not tested\" since they said it was the largest observed since 1975 for periods of those lenthgs? or maybe just large. ","River flow sampling began a lot earlier than ecological sampling (1/1995)- ok that that sample date isn't in this spreadsheet? Also, the ecological data came from a Digital Elevation Model of Difference, which was then checked by looking at arial photos. That's ok right- not modeling?","This paper did include two flood events (2005 and 2014). They do a poor job distinguishing the effects of the two events, and for most of the variables they were the same (e.g. the channel profile changed both times). But - I would propose including the two events as separate entries. Also, I don't think they tested the significance of the chnage in the channel profile ","They also include information for water temperature, water velocity, ph, conductance, and dissolved oxygen- Table 3- for an el nino year vs. a non el-nino year; do we want to include this?","NaN","Got it! Not sure how we deal with that in the data, but I think the way you did this makes sense.","NaN","NaN","NaN","Studied three different heat waves; only one was described as extreme. Only included the most exterme heatwave. Looked at three different types of systems (low-land; reservoir fed/high altitude; and snow-fed); included a different response for each","Table 4 shows that, after the third event, the three ecological responses changed significantly- I would change to to \"-sig\" instead of \"-significance not tested\". Not sure for sediment- it looks like day had a significant impact on sediment (table 3), so maybe that goes to \"small - sig\"?","body condition = body mass adjusted to body size - maybe could categorized as biomass so that we don't add another option to the column? I'm not sure","NaN","I think watershed/catchment is correct. I think we leave EVI as is since it is a proxy for both plant cover and productivity. A broader question on the definition of extreme events - the authors state that the hurricanes were classified as cateogry 3 and 5. Does this classification count as an 'exteme event' even though it is not explicitly stated so?","A little confusing; kind of measured an extreme event? But did not continue to monitor after the event.","I think it's debatable whether we include this paper - they are using a real extreme event but a modeled (not empirical) response variable.","I agree this study was ambiguous -- I might change actual extreme event from Y to N. Extreme events were described as &gt; 4cm precipitation within 24 hours and the frequency of such rain events was compared for two locations. While this is a numerical definition, I don't feel like it is a staistical definition, which I would see more as something like \"extreme events are more rain in 24 hours than 99% of rain events\" or \"greater than 2 standard deviations above average\" or something like that ... ? I also think that the moss coverage should be added as the biological response (they also measure species composition but did not relate it to other variables?)- The stream with higher frequency of \"extreme\" rain events suffered significantly more losses of moss plots than the stream with less rain (would classify effect as small-sig). They measured other parameters (soil texture, soil pH, soil electrical conductivity, bank slope, %canopy cover, and leaf cover) for each plot at each visit, while sites were different in regards to several of these, only erosion was related to moss loss.","changed from coastal veg-grasses to submerged aquatic vegetation- seagrass is an SAV, I think coastal veg-grasses are for terrestrial grasses?","NaN","Should we call it desiccation rather than drought, or is that a jargon difference between freshwater &amp;
